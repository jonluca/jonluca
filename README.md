Hi! 

I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/jonluca"><b>JonLuca DeCaro</b></a>. I grew up in north east Italy, and moved to the United States in 2014 to study in Los Angeles. I'm currently a Growth Engineer in San Francisco, CA at Pinterest.

Previously I worked at Google, Apple, and Elevate Security. I currently do free lance growth consulting and development work under JonLuca DeCaro Consulting.

## New here?

I recommend starting with the following three posts. They all focus on tech and explorations of topics I find interesting.

1. [Illegal streams, decrypting m3u8's, and building a better stream experience](https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/illegal-streams?ref=about) - An article on exploring illegal sports streams online, building a client to watch them, and seeing how the streamers are piggybacking real services.

2. [Obfuscated javascript, scam emails, and American Express](https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/deobfuscating-amex-scammer?ref=about) - An article on reversing and decompiling obfuscated javascript, tracking spam emails, and finding the root command and control server for a scam campaign.

3. [Ryanair, Hamiltonian Cycles, and using graph theory to find cheap flights](https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/ryan-air?ref=about) - An article on how I routed my European vacation, writing an NP hard problem solver, and releasing a tool to help you do the same.

I also write for HackerNoon and freeCodeCamp on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonluca).
